### NLP and Unsupervised Learning Project Proposal ###

**Purpose:** The goal of this project is to build a hotel recommendation system where top 5 similiar hotels can be recommended to the user based on the hotel he/she is originally interested in (searched in the search box).

**Dataset:** Hotel names, address, star rating, about this area (description about attractions in the vicinity of the hotel), and about this property (description about the amenities of the hotel) will be scraped from Expedia.com.  Hotels in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, and New York City will be gathered in the dataset, and this makes up about 1,200 observations.  Each observation is a hotel and its information.

**Algorithms:** 

* Will be determined after more lectures

**Tools**: 

* Python text processing libraries/tools (NLTK, gensim, scikit-learn)
* BeautifulSoup
* Selenium
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**MVP Goal:** A minimum viable product could be a model recommending the top 10 hotels based on the user's requirement.
