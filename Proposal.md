### NLP Proposal ###

**Purpose:** The goal of this project is to build a hotel recommendation system where top 5 similar hotels can be recommended to the user based on the hotel he/she searched in the search box.

**Dataset:** Hotel names, address, star rating, about this area (description about attractions around the hotel), and about this property (description about the amenities of the hotel) will be scraped from Expedia.com.  Hotels in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, New York City, and cities in the vicinity of these five cities will be gathered in the dataset.

**Algorithms:** 

* Will be determined after more lectures

**Tools**: 

* Python text processing libraries/tools (NLTK, gensim, scikit-learn)
* BeautifulSoup
* Selenium
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**MVP Goal:** A minimum viable product could be a model recommending the top 5 hotels based on the user's input hotel.
